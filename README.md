# AVDemonCamManual: Using the Manual Capture API (for something useful)

### Description
AVCamManual adds manual controls for focus, exposure, and white balance to the AVCam sample application. AVDemonCamManual helps you give a damn.

#### New for iOS 10

AVCamManual now uses AVCapturePhotoOutput rather than AVCaptureStillImageOutput, and adds support for raw photo capture. AVDemonCamManual uses none of that. Photos of cloaked demons are created from video stills. 



## Requirements

### Build

Xcode 8, iOS 10 SDK

### Runtime

iOS 10.0
